## Describe each of the four GIFs 
GIF one is a gif of a flower rotating with perfect looping

GIF two is a variant of gif one with perfect looping

GIF three is gif using noise to draw on the screen

GIF four is a perfect looping GIF of flowers moving up and down the screen

## What P5 method or technique did you enjoy using the most? What was interesting to you about it?

I enjoyed using noise the most, though I didn't do much with it.

## Did you find any P5 functionality that wasn't covered in class?
 
preloading images AND fonts into the canvas and using them.

## How did you get your looping gif to loop smoothly? What was hard or easy about that techinque?
 
Very smooth looping using a value of theta, it made it easy because using modulo and looptime resets the animation.
